# Injury-Analysis-Python-Project

I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

Soccer is a growing sport in the US and with the World Cup being hosted here next summer, I thought it would be interesting to do an injury analysis on players.

Sports are an integral part of many people's lives. Whether it's sports betting, a fantasy league, or a team you are a die hard fan of. I fall in the category of a die hard fan and thought it would be fun to explore data from the English Premier League. Managers and Team owners have to make decisions about the players on their team about whether to sell, keep, let go, start, or use as a substitute.

I approached this overarching question by looking at data of injured players based on age group (Under 27, 27 and Older), the type of injury, and whether they had one injury or multiple injuries.

For this project, I primarily focused on 7 Premier League teams: Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Everton, Burnley, and Brentford.
